Assignment Title: Java Fundamentals

Assignment Description:
You are tasked with creating a Java program to manage a student's information and their grades. This program should utilize the concepts covered in the following topics:

Basic Syntax and Data Types
Operators and Expressions
Control Flow Statements
Methods and Functions
Classes and Objects
Assignment Tasks:

Define a class called "Student" with the following attributes:
 Name (String)
 Age (int)
 Grade (double)
 Status (boolean indicating whether the student is active or not)

Implement constructors for the "Student" class:
 A default constructor that initializes the attributes with default values.
 A parameterized constructor that takes values for the name, age, and grade.

Create methods within the "Student" class to:
    Display student information.
    Update student's grade.
    Check if the student is eligible for promotion to the next grade based on a passing grade threshold.

Implement a main class called "StudentManagement" with the following functionalities:
    Create instances of the "Student" class.
    Display student information.
    Update student grades.
    Check eligibility for promotion.

Utilize control flow statements such as if-else statements and loops (for, while, or do-while) to control the flow of execution in your program.
Demonstrate the usage of various operators and expressions within your program, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.
